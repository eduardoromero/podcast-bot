# Podcast Bot
A Chat Bot that manages a Catalog of Podcast recommendations.

## The rationale behind it
We have a Slack channel at the office where anybody can post a Podcast Site or Episode that they liked or found so interesting that they'd like to share it with the team.


## User Stories
### I'd like to share a great Episode
- You would add a link to the one episode you want to share.
- Optionally, Add a description so it's easier to find.
- Optionally, Add some "tags" or "categories" so it's easier to catalog.
- Aditionally,[by some kind of magic] we would scrape the link and try to find metadata.

### I'd like to help to curate the data we have so others can find even better things to listen to.
- After I listened to a superb (or lousy) episode I can add feedback to the link.
  - In Slack by Reacting.
  - In the Web by clicking something.
  - In other platforms somehow. (Because we always build a multiplatform Bots).
