# Podcast Bot
A Chat Bot that manages Podcast recommendations.

## The rationale behind it
We have a Slack channel at the office where anybody can post a Podcast Site or Episode that they liked or found so interesting that they'd like to share it with the team.


## User Stories

- Optionally, Add a description so it's easier to find.
- Optionally, Add some "tags" or "categories" so it's easier to catalog.
- Aditionally,[by some kind of magic] we would scrape the link and try to find metadata.
